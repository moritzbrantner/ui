- **UI-002 — Show information where it changes a decision** — Give prominence only to information that changes understanding or next action; do not repeat facts already visible. ([details](modules/ui/conventions/interface-design/README.md))
- **UI-005 — Make primary workflows keyboard-first and commands discoverable** — Make every primary workflow keyboard-completable. ([details](modules/ui/conventions/interface-design/README.md))
- **UI-006 — Make interactive data views accessible and shareable** — Use charts only when interaction adds understanding; provide equivalent structured values. ([details](modules/ui/conventions/interface-design/README.md))
- **UI-007 — Make primary workflows work on touch and mobile** — Preserve primary tasks, hierarchy, state, and required actions on representative mobile and touch input. ([details](modules/ui/conventions/interface-design/README.md))
- **UI-008 — Make numeric editor controls precision-first** — Provide directly editable numeric values for precision-sensitive parameters, including dimensions, position, rotation, timing, cuts, simulation settings, and effect parameters. Do not use slider-only controls; a value label or tooltip is not exact entry. ([details](modules/ui/conventions/interface-design/README.md))
- **UI-009 — Make functional screens task-first, not promotional** — On representative target viewports, put the primary task, current content or state, and frequent actions before generic introductions. ([details](modules/ui/conventions/interface-design/README.md))
- **UI-010 — Make persistent UI earn its space** — Every persistent navigation item, toolbar control, panel, badge, or card must support a recurring task, a real destination, or decision-relevant state. ([details](modules/ui/conventions/interface-design/README.md))
- **UI-011 — Make empty states operational** — State what is absent and expose the most likely next action. ([details](modules/ui/conventions/interface-design/README.md))
- **MORITZUI-001 — Compose applications from public component tiers** — Select public exports by semantic responsibility: stable primitives, patterns compositions, data collections, and shell chrome. ([details](modules/moritzbrantner-ui/technologies/typescript/react/moritzbrantner-ui/README.md))
- **MORITZUI-002 — Select one concrete theme contract** — Import exactly one concrete theme stylesheet per application surface. ([details](modules/moritzbrantner-ui/technologies/typescript/react/moritzbrantner-ui/README.md))
- **MORITZUI-003 — Do not add counters or KPI cards by default** — Do not add cards, tiles, hero statistics, or dashboard widgets whose primary purpose is merely to display a count or total. ([details](modules/moritzbrantner-ui/technologies/typescript/react/moritzbrantner-ui/README.md))
- **BUN-001 — Use Bun as the default JavaScript toolchain** — Use Bun for packages, scripts, and JavaScript/TypeScript where required tooling supports it. ([details](modules/tooling/technologies/tooling/README.md))
- **TAILWIND-001 — Prefer Tailwind CSS when practical** — Prefer Tailwind for application styling when utility classes preserve ownership near the markup. ([details](modules/tooling/technologies/tooling/README.md))
- **TAILWIND-002 — Use semantic tokens and named variants** — Use semantic tokens and named variants for visual decisions. ([details](modules/tooling/technologies/tooling/README.md))
- **PLAYWRIGHT-001 — Test critical observable workflows** — Cover user-visible workflows that focused tests cannot prove using accessible selectors, URLs, and observable outcomes. ([details](modules/playwright/technologies/tooling/playwright/README.md))
- **PLAYWRIGHT-002 — Own the environment and preserve failure evidence** — Explicitly provision servers, data, services, ports, and teardown; retain enough artifacts to reproduce failures. ([details](modules/playwright/technologies/tooling/playwright/README.md))
- **STORYBOOK-001 — Stories are executable UI contracts** — Keep meaningful reusable UI states in deterministic, colocated stories with explicit fixtures or mocks. ([details](modules/storybook/technologies/tooling/storybook/README.md))
- **STORYBOOK-002 — Build and audit Storybook in automation** — Treat the static build and accessibility audit of every included story as deterministic automation gates. ([details](modules/storybook/technologies/tooling/storybook/README.md))
- **RTL-001 — Test observable user behavior** — Interact through user-facing controls and assert observable outcomes, not React internals. ([details](modules/testing-library/technologies/typescript/react/testing-library/README.md))
- **RTL-002 — Use Testing Library's semantic query APIs** — Apply TEST-020 through Testing Library's user-facing query APIs, preferring roles with accessible names, then labels and visible text where appropriate. ([details](modules/testing-library/technologies/typescript/react/testing-library/README.md))
- **RTL-003 — Apply DOM testing progressively** — Do not require a React Testing Library test merely because a React component exists. ([details](modules/testing-library/technologies/typescript/react/testing-library/README.md))
- **RTL-004 — Model interactions through user events** — Prefer `userEvent.setup()` and awaited user interactions for normal input, pointer, and keyboard behavior. ([details](modules/testing-library/technologies/typescript/react/testing-library/README.md))
- **RTL-005 — Wait for observable asynchronous state** — Wait for the state the user can observe with semantic async queries or bounded waiting helpers. ([details](modules/testing-library/technologies/typescript/react/testing-library/README.md))
- **RTL-006 — Keep component composition real by default** — Prefer rendering real child components and providers over mocking React implementation boundaries. ([details](modules/testing-library/technologies/typescript/react/testing-library/README.md))
- **RTL-007 — Avoid snapshot-only and duplicate confidence** — Prefer explicit behavioral assertions over broad DOM snapshots. Use small snapshots only when the serialized or rendered shape is itself a meaningful contract. ([details](modules/testing-library/technologies/typescript/react/testing-library/README.md))
- **VITEST-001 — Separate execution kinds with names and scripts** — Keep tests at their dependency scope; encode kind in filenames such as .unit.test.ts, .integration.test.ts, or .bench.ts. ([details](modules/vitest/technologies/tooling/vitest/README.md))
- **VITEST-002 — Do not commit focused or silently disabled tests** — Focused tests such as `test.only`/`describe.only` fail deterministic verification. ([details](modules/vitest/technologies/tooling/vitest/README.md))
