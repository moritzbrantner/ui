- **TAILWIND-001 — Prefer Tailwind CSS when practical** — Prefer Tailwind for application styling when utility classes preserve ownership near the markup. ([details](modules/tooling/technologies/tooling/README.md))
- **TAILWIND-002 — Use semantic tokens and named variants** — Use semantic tokens and named variants for visual decisions. ([details](modules/tooling/technologies/tooling/README.md))
- **PLAYWRIGHT-001 — Test critical observable workflows** — Cover user-visible workflows that focused tests cannot prove using accessible selectors, URLs, and observable outcomes. ([details](modules/playwright/technologies/tooling/playwright/README.md))
- **PLAYWRIGHT-002 — Own the environment and preserve failure evidence** — Explicitly provision servers, data, services, ports, and teardown; retain enough artifacts to reproduce failures. ([details](modules/playwright/technologies/tooling/playwright/README.md))
- **STORYBOOK-001 — Stories are executable UI contracts** — Keep meaningful reusable UI states in deterministic, colocated stories with explicit fixtures or mocks. ([details](modules/storybook/technologies/tooling/storybook/README.md))
- **STORYBOOK-002 — Build and audit Storybook in automation** — Treat the static build and accessibility audit of every included story as deterministic automation gates. ([details](modules/storybook/technologies/tooling/storybook/README.md))
- **RTL-001 — Test observable user behavior** — Interact through user-facing controls and assert observable outcomes, not React internals. ([details](modules/testing-library/technologies/typescript/react/testing-library/README.md))
- **RTL-002 — Use Testing Library's semantic query APIs** — Apply TEST-020 through Testing Library's user-facing query APIs, preferring roles with accessible names, then labels and visible text where appropriate. ([details](modules/testing-library/technologies/typescript/react/testing-library/README.md))
- **RTL-003 — Apply DOM testing progressively** — Do not require a React Testing Library test merely because a React component exists. ([details](modules/testing-library/technologies/typescript/react/testing-library/README.md))
- **RTL-004 — Model interactions through user events** — Prefer `userEvent.setup()` and awaited user interactions for normal input, pointer, and keyboard behavior. ([details](modules/testing-library/technologies/typescript/react/testing-library/README.md))
- **RTL-005 — Wait for observable asynchronous state** — Wait for the state the user can observe with semantic async queries or bounded waiting helpers. ([details](modules/testing-library/technologies/typescript/react/testing-library/README.md))
- **RTL-006 — Keep component composition real by default** — Prefer rendering real child components and providers over mocking React implementation boundaries. ([details](modules/testing-library/technologies/typescript/react/testing-library/README.md))
- **RTL-007 — Avoid snapshot-only and duplicate confidence** — Prefer explicit behavioral assertions over broad DOM snapshots. Use small snapshots only when the serialized or rendered shape is itself a meaningful contract. ([details](modules/testing-library/technologies/typescript/react/testing-library/README.md))
- **VITEST-001 — Separate execution kinds with names and scripts** — Keep tests at their dependency scope; encode kind in filenames such as .unit.test.ts, .integration.test.ts, or .bench.ts. ([details](modules/vitest/technologies/tooling/vitest/README.md))
- **VITEST-002 — Do not commit focused or silently disabled tests** — Focused tests such as `test.only`/`describe.only` fail deterministic verification. ([details](modules/vitest/technologies/tooling/vitest/README.md))
